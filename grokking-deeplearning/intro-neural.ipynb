    "The funtion neural_network is a representation of a neural network in python. It takes in inputs and weights and multiplies each data point to predict a particular value. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is Input data?\n",
    "It is a number that is recorded in the real world and it usually somethign that is knowable, it can be tooday's temperature. or yesterday's stock price or the image of a cat. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is a Prediction?\n",
    "A prediction is what the neural informs is based on the provided input such as \"given yesterday's Microsoft stock price, the stock price will be 150.52\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions are not always right, sometime the neural networks makes mistakes and it can also learn from these mistakes, if it sees the prediction was weither too high or too low, it makes changes the weigh either up or down based on the predictions results so as to predict more accurately next time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the Neural Network work?\n",
    "Basically, it mulplies the input by a weight, that is it scales the input by a certail anount. The weight is a number that is learned by the neural network. The neural network is trained on a dataset, and it learns the weights that will give it the best results. The weights are adjusted based on the difference between the predicted value and the actual value. "
